# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the master branch
on:
  # pull_request:
  #   branches:
  #     - develop
  #   types: [closed]
  push:
    branches:
      - master

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # if: github.event.pull_request.merged == true
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
